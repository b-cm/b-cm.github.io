## About Me

*My pronouns are he/him.*

I am a 6th-year PhD candidate studying at the University of Virginia.

In my academic research, I use numerical radiation hydrodynamics simulations to explore astrophysical problems ranging from exoplanet atmospheres to thermonuclear explosions on the surfaces of neutron stars.
